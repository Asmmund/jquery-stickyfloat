   Want your box to float beside you as you scroll, but ONLY in a
   specific constrained area? or only on it's parents area? - you got it.

   when content exceeds size.

   -----------

     * duration - the duration of the animation

     * startOffset - the amount of scroll offset after it the animations
       kicks in

     * offsetY - the offset from the top when the object is animated

     * lockBottom - 'true' by default, set to false if you don't want
       your floating box to stop at parent's bottom
